Welcome to PokeQuotes:

This project explores web site scraping, combining the data from multiple sources into an easily digestible (enjoyable) widget and rendering a Pokedex completely styled with CSS and animated with JavaScript. The input form will request a link from a Pokemon sprites library and a link to a quote page on the BrainyQuote site.

Future Enhancements:
- Better CSS Styling for Pokedex
- Potential audio generated
- More functionality in Pokedex "buttons"
- Create Pokedexes specific to the generation of the Pokemon being rendered
- String manipulate the quote to match the Pokemon in some way
- Drop-down for Pokemon selection
- Export of widgets
- Data caching
- Create more interesting data outputs
